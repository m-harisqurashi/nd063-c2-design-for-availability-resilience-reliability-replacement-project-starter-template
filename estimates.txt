1. Minimum RTO for a single AZ outage
	The time it takes to start up a new RDS instance in a new AZ. In this case, I estimated this is to be about 1-2 minutes
2. Minimum RTO for a single region outage
	This will be the time a single region takes to switch to the read replica in another region. I estimated this to be about 5-10 minutes
3. Minimum RPO for a single AZ outage
	Data loss is minimal as the system fails over from one instance to another instance causes RPO to be zero
4. Minimum RPO for a single region outage
	A relatively longer RPO for about one hour would be reasonable for a single region outage
